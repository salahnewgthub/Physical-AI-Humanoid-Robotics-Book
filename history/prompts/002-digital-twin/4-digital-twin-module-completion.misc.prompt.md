prompt_text: |
  Complete the implementation of Module 2 – The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book.
response_text: |
  Successfully completed the implementation of the Digital Twin module:
  - Created comprehensive specification, plan, and tasks documents
  - Developed all required documentation chapters (3 chapters + index)
  - Updated sidebar navigation to include the new module
  - Created content covering physics simulation with Gazebo, high-fidelity environments with Unity, and simulation-to-reality transfer
  - All content is conceptual-focused as requested, with minimal code and emphasis on understanding
outcome: |
  The Digital Twin module (Gazebo & Unity) is fully implemented and integrated into the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book.
  The module is ready for review and publication.
evaluation: |
  All deliverables have been completed according to the specification. The module covers both Gazebo and Unity simulation platforms with appropriate focus on conceptual understanding rather than implementation details.
