# Digital Twin: Gazebo & Unity Simulation

Welcome to the Digital Twin module, where you'll explore the critical role of simulation in Physical AI and humanoid robotics. This module covers two complementary simulation platforms that form the foundation of modern robotics development: Gazebo for physics simulation and Unity for high-fidelity visualization and interaction.

## What You'll Learn

In this module, you'll understand how digital twins—virtual replicas of physical systems—enable safe and efficient development of humanoid robots. You'll explore:

- **Physics Simulation with Gazebo**: Learn how realistic physics engines model gravity, collisions, and dynamics for safe robot testing
- **Visual Simulation with Unity**: Discover how high-fidelity environments and human-robot interaction simulation enhance robotics development
- **Simulation-to-Reality Transfer**: Understand the challenges and strategies for applying simulation results to real robots

## Why Digital Twins Matter

Digital twins serve as safe testing grounds where complex humanoid robot behaviors can be developed and validated without risk of expensive hardware damage or safety concerns. This approach accelerates development cycles and enables comprehensive testing of robot systems in diverse virtual environments.
