# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book. This comprehensive guide explores how artificial intelligence connects to humanoid robot bodies through middleware systems like ROS 2, enabling sensing, decision-making, and actuation.

## About This Book

This book is designed for AI engineers and Python developers who are new to robotics and ROS 2. Each module builds upon the previous to provide a solid foundation in connecting AI intelligence to physical robot systems.

## Modules

- **Module 1**: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) - Understanding ROS 2 as middleware connecting AI to humanoid robot bodies
