# Tasks: Digital Twin Module (Gazebo & Unity)

## Feature Overview

- **Feature**: Digital Twin Module (Gazebo & Unity)
- **Platform**: Docusaurus
- **Target**: AI and robotics learners familiar with ROS 2 basics
- **Focus**: Teaching digital twins for humanoid robot simulation

## Implementation Strategy

- MVP: Create basic conceptual content for Gazebo physics simulation
